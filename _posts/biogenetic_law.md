Introduction The Archimedes Palimpsest

In medieval Europe, scrolls were often recycled due to the high cost of producing parchment, which was made from animal skin. These recycled manuscripts were called palimpsests, a word that derives from ancient Greek palimpsēstos, which means engraved again. In 1906, one of these palimpsests was found to contain three mathematical treatises by Archimedes, covered by psalms and prayers from a convent. They were recovered with X-Ray technology and Artificial Intelligence. This is the way in which we rudimentarily recover pieces of our past wisdom.

Why do I mention this I want to drive the following point home living organisms function like these recycled manuscripts. We are palimpsests of evolution, whether by organs or vestigial genes, by atavisms, or by curious characteristics of embryonic development.

Part 1 Vestigial Organs, Atavisms, and Pseudogenes

If you have ever been to a museum and seen a complete whale skeleton, you will have seen that some hind leg bones or pelvic bones are suspended with wires. This is because these structures were once part of the skeleton, but in current whales, they are disconnected and shrunken, simply suspended in the tissue when they cease to be necessary after succeeding generations. The same is true for dolphins. These are examples of vestigial organs, which the Encyclopedia of Animal Cognition and Behavior defines as an anatomical structure that has lost its original function in a species during the course of evolution.

Vestigial organs should not be confused with cases such as that of a human being who is born with a tail instead of a coccyx or a whale that is born with hind legs (even with feet and toes!). These are cases of atavisms, a word that comes from the Latin word atavus, which means ancestor. These are anomalous reappearances of ancestral characteristics in individuals. They differ from the vestigial organs mentioned previously because they appear sporadically in some individuals, instead of in all or almost all individuals in a species.

Atavisms and vestigial characteristics show us that when a structure is reduced or disappears, the genes that carry its information do not immediately disappear from the genome evolution inactivates them by means of molecular machinery. That is to say, although we do not see the organs themselves, their genes are still present.

From this, we can make a prediction we should find, in the genome of many species, silenced or dead genes that do not code for any particular protein. Genes that were once useful but are no longer expressed or have lost their original form. In contrast, the creationist idea that all species were created as they are today, would predict that such genes should not exist... what would be the point In fact, these genes that do not work exist in large quantities, and we call them pseudogenes. Out of the approximately 30 thousand human genes, between 10,000 and 20,000 are estimated to be pseudogenes, including many that are not necessarily atavistic.

One example of an atavistic pseudogene is GULOP (Gulonolactone L-Oxidase, Pseudogene), a non-functional version of a gene that allowed our ancestors to synthesize vitamin C. While most mammals still have an active GULO gene in their liver, humans and other primates carry only a mutated, non-functional version, which forces us to obtain vitamin C from our diet. But why do we have this gene if it no longer works We can think of it as a molecular fossil, a silent witness to our evolutionary history, preserved in every cell of our body.

To be fair though, not all pseudogenes are junk DNA, as scientists first assumed. Extensive research has shown that some pseudogenes play crucial regulatory roles. One such example is PTENP1 (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Pseudogene 1), a broken copy of PTEN, a gene that produces a tumor-suppressing protein. While PTENP1 does not encode a protein, it is transcribed to a long non-coding RNA that helps protect PTEN’s function. If the pseudogene is missing, the risk of cancer increases. Perhaps GULOP could evolve a regulatory role like PTENP1, or may already have. But even if it did, its atavistic nature would remain nothing can change the fact that it used to produce vitamin C as its original function.

Part 2 Ernst Haeckel's Biogenetic Law and Comparative Embryology

Mammals evolved from reptiles, which in turn did so from amphibians, which originally did so from aquatic organisms. Mammals like us, that developed a placenta instead of laying eggs like our ancestors, still produce a vestigial yolk sac, akin to an egg yolk! It is a balloon-like structure filled with fluid, attached to the intestine of the fetus. In humans, it disappears in the second month of pregnancy. Previously believed to have no function, it has been recently shown to provide nutrition and gas exchange between the mother and the developing embryo, before the placenta forms and can take over. This is precisely analogous to the function of an egg yolk.

In addition, the embryos of some species have branchial arches, early structures that in fish and sharks develop into gills and the jaw, but in mammals end up forming completely different structures, such as the carotid artery, the tonsil, the larynx, and others facial structures.

A most perplexing fact (and this is what struck me the most when I began to study this subject) is that the changes in the development of our embryonic circulatory system seem to follow an evolutionary sequence. The human embryo goes from resembling the embryo of a fish, to that of a reptile, to that of an amphibian, until it finally ends up looking exclusively mammal-like. The embryo of a mammal once resembled that of a fish, but not the other way around. The embryo of a reptile, likewise, went through the previous steps of fish, and then amphibian.

But why does this happen Most likely, when a species evolves, it inherits the developmental program of its ancestor – and development is a highly conservative process. This means that many structures that appear later in an evolutionary sequence, need biochemical signals of characteristics that appeared beforehand. The pillars of growth are the metabolic, developmental, and functional pathways of the previous stages.

Following this logic, Ernst Haeckel, an evolutionary biologist contemporary to Darwin, formulated the Biogenetic Law, also known as the Theory of Recapitulation, in 1866. It claimed that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Ontogeny is the study of the embryonic development, and phylogeny is the study of evolutionary relationships between organisms. This means that he thought embryonic development always testifies to the stages of the evolutionary history of a species.

In truth, this is neither inevitable nor strictly true. For example, in plants, this law is not observed. The Biogenetic Law was thus discredited in the 20th century, and today it is not considered the predominant line of thought for the development of an embryo. One of the arguments used to discredit Haeckel, was that in his illustrations he exaggerated the embryonic traits to make them more similar to adult species of other animals, while in reality embryos resemble other non-adult embryos.

Although everything Haeckel posited is not really so, I don't think the spirit behind his pursuits should be completely dismissed. Embryology does speak of a fascinating evolutionary reality, so let's not throw the embryo out with the bathwater.

Some closing words

I hope you enjoyed this read! I made most of my research for this post in 2022, based chiefly on the first edition of the book Why Evolution is True, written in 2009 by the American biologist Jerry Coyne, who is a professor at the University of Chicago. I recommend this read to general audiences, since it was written in the very accessible vocabulary characteristic of pop science books. If you are interested in these topics it is a good place to start. However, I did find some out-of-date information in it. So, if i made a mistake or you have something to contribute or update, feel free to leave a comment. Science, as well as its communication, is collaborative.
