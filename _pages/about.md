Hello! I’m a Biotechnologist from Buenos Aires, Argentina, with experience in both wet-lab research and computational biology. I earned my 5-year degree at Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (UADE) in 2025, completing my thesis work at the Molecular and Functional Glycomics Laboratory (IBYME-CONICET). My scientific interests focus on the nervous system —ranging from brain cancers such as glioblastoma and neuroblastoma to neurodegenerative diseases and the biology of ageing— with the goal of contributing to new insights and therapies that improve human health.

I'm currently looking for open PhD positions. You can download my CV [here].
