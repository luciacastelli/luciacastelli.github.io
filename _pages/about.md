Hello! I am a Biotechnologist from Argentina with experience in both computational biology and wet-lab research. I earned my degree at Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (UADE) in 2025, completing my thesis at the [Molecular and Functional Glycomics Laboratory (IBYME-CONICET)](https://ibyme.org.ar/investigacion/en/laboratories/molecular-and-functional-glycomics/).

My research interests center on developing new therapies to improve human health, with a focus on the nervous system. I am particularly interested in the biology of cancers such as neuroblastoma and glioblastoma, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing, and in the role of immunity in these contexts.

I'm currently seeking jobs and PhD opportunities. You can download my CV <a href="/files/CV2025.pdf" download="Lucia_Castelli_CV.pdf">here</a>.
