**Abstract**:
  
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory diseases that produce functional and structural abnormalities in the digestive tract. In IBD, the chronicity of inflammation increases the risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CACRC). This type of neoplasia shows molecular and genetic patterns similar to those in sporadic colorectal cancer; however, both types of cancer differ in the chronology and sequence of appearance of these alterations, causing, in the case of CACRC, a faster malignant transformation, with multiple foci of origin. To reduce inflammation in IBD, first-line treatment employs immunosuppressive agents. However, there is debate over whether their prolonged use could promote tumor development. For this reason, the treatment of CACRC is complex, and today all efforts are dedicated to preventing malignancy through endoscopic surveillance, without biomarkers for the prediction of neoplasia in these patients.

Considering that protein glycosylation is one of the most abundant post-translational modifications, and that it mediates relevant cellular mechanisms (with a particularly important role in the immune response), the central objective of this Thesis is to identify a glycobiological signature that contributes to the development of new diagnostic and/or prevention strategies in patients with UC and at risk of developing CACRC. To this end, public transcriptomics databases of patients with intestinal inflammation (left ulcerative colitis and pancolitis), dysplasia, and colitis-associated neoplasia, were analyzed.
  
The joint analysis of these results and data from murine models allowed to delineate a signature of 10 dysregulated glycogenes in a model of CACRC with respect to one of intestinal inflammation (azoxymethane/sodium dextran sulfate, AOM-DSS): *Defa5, Lgals4, Lgals12, Slc26a2* (upregulated), *Icam1, Sell, Selp, St3gal1, Chi3l1*, and *Chil3* (downregulated). We studied the dysregulation of four of these genes (*Defa5, Lgals4, Lgals12* and *St3gal1*) by RT-qPCR in a model of DSS-induced colitis and CACRC (AOM-DSS). This approach allowed validating the altered expression of *Defa5* (defensin 5), and supports future research of the glycobiological signature obtained in samples from patients with CACRC, with the aim of implementing early diagnosic strategies in patients with UC.
