I developed a web application for interactive visualization of differential expression data, available here: [https://lcastelli.shinyapps.io/degsv/](https://lcastelli.shinyapps.io/degsv/).

The application allows users to upload their own results in `.csv` format, with the following required columns (exact names):

- **gene** – gene name
- **logFC** – log fold change
- **p** – adjusted p-value

Files must not contain special characters (e.g., “á,” “í,” “!”). If no file is uploaded, an example dataset from my MSc. Thesis (2025) is provided.

#### Features
**Table view**

- Displays numerical values (3 significant figures) with interactive filtering by p-value and logFC thresholds.
- Default cutoffs: p = 0.05 and |logFC| = 2.
- The number of up- and down-regulated genes is dynamically reported in the sidebar (e.g., “Up: 12, Down: 7”).

**Chart view**

- Generates a volcano plot of differential expression results.
- Reference lines (p-value, logFC) update automatically when thresholds are changed.
- Hovering over points shows gene names and values; clicking highlights a gene and links it to the NCBI database.
- Double-clicking outside points clears the selection.
- The plot can be downloaded as a `.png` file.

**NCBI integration**

Clicking on a gene opens its entry in [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), displayed directly in the third tab of the application.
